    %h2 Macroscope
    %p LifeViz offers users a macroscope that expands your field of view as opposed to contracting it.  An interactive graph gives you the big picture across the tree of life so you can see trends that emerge from the data and easily find surprising outliers.  Complex and far reaching data is displayed in a useful easy to navigate way. 
  .contribute
